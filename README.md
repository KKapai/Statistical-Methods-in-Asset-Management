In the report, we built investment portfolios of 15 stocks in the US market.
Monthly Stock price from 2013-02-01 to 2019-11-01 sourced from Yahoo. We
explored the individual features and joint distribution of the assets. The 15
assets are either normally, t, or skewed-t distributed. Correlation matrix, PCA,
and Copulas suggest that they are only slightly correlated, so it is easy to
diversify non-systemic risk. Taking both risk and return into account, we
constructed efficient frontier, MVP (Minimum Variance Portfolio) and
tangency portfolio of the 15 assets. The tangency portfolio, either short
allowed or not allowed, has higher Sharpe ratio and lower Value-at-Risk and
Expected Shortfall than any individual asset.
